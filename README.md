InarBooking Automation Project
Introduction
Welcome to the InarBooking Test Automation Project, a regal endeavor aimed at ensuring the seamless functionality and unwavering reliability of the majestic booking website, inarbooking.com. As stewards of precision and excellence, our mission is to implement an automated testing framework that befits the grandeur of this esteemed platform.

Purpose
This endeavor seeks to fortify the digital fortress of InarBooking, safeguarding its kingdom of reservations and enchanting experiences. By employing the noble art of test automation, we pledge allegiance to the royal standards of quality assurance, leaving no room for the intrusion of bugs or glitches in the realm of seamless online booking.

How to Contribute
As noble contributors to this quest, aspiring knights and ladies are invited to join our prestigious order. Follow the ceremonial steps below to partake in the refinement of InarBooking's digital dominion:

1 - Clone the Repository:
Clone repository via using GitBash git clone command

2 - Install Dependencies:
Install dependencies via mvn install command

3 - Update Configurations:
Update configurations via navigating to config.properties,CukesRunner,extent.properties etc. with the appropriate credentials and regal settings.

4 - Run Java Spring Format:
In order to prevent formatting violations run mvn spring-javaformat:apply command

5 - Run the Tests:
Run desired noble tests via mvn test

Test Suite Structure
Behold the grand architectural design of the InarBooking Automation Project, where each facet of the structure is crafted with the precision and elegance befitting a royal court.

Project encapsulates the power of Singleton, ensuring that essential entities such as the WebDriver and configuration settings stand as solitary sentinels, ready to serve the kingdom without the burden of duplicity.

Page Object Model
To navigate the royal corridors of InarBooking with finesse and clarity, the Page Object Model (POM) is the map that guides our automation knights. Behold the regal structure. Each page of the InarBooking website is represented by a corresponding Java class, encapsulating the locators and actions specific to that page. The Page Object Model ensures that the code is as lucid and noble as the design it seeks to validate.

Singleton Design Pattern
In the realm of automation, our codebase proudly embraces the Singleton Design Pattern, a majestic architectural choice that ensures the instantiation of a single, global instance of vital classes. This pattern, akin to an unyielding sentinel at the gates of a castle, safeguards the sanctity of critical resources and prevents unnecessary replication. Witness the splendor of our design in the following structure: Automated Tests Our illustrious test suite encompasses a series of automated tests that traverse the kingdom of InarBooking, validating the integrity of its booking functionalities. These tests are meticulously crafted to emulate the actions of the most discerning users, ensuring that the website's royal features remain steadfast and reliable.

Driver Safety for Multithreading
In our noble quest for automation excellence, the challenge of multithreading is met with the vigilance of seasoned guardians. The WebDriver, a chariot of unparalleled importance, is handled with utmost care to ensure thread safety. The regal approach to multithreading is encapsulated in the structure. Project orchestrates the synchronized dance of threads, ensuring that the WebDriver, like a chariot, glides smoothly through the lanes of InarBooking without the chaos of collisions.

May the Singleton, Multithreading, and Page Object Model stand as pillars of strength in our endeavor, fortifying the InarBooking Automation Project against the tides of complexity.
Reporting
Witness the majestic reports generated by our automation knights, detailing the outcome of each valiant test. These reports shall serve as scrolls of transparency, allowing all stakeholders to gaze upon the triumphs and challenges faced during the noble quest for a bug-free domain.

May the Code Be Ever Regal!
